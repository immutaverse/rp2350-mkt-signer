WARNING:   This Repo uses our propriatary logic in propriatary Docker images
   which use propriatary logic in our cloud to validate your contract and 
   record signing events.  We  do not copy your private key or other confidential
   information or send it to the cloud.  Our goal is to provide firmware signing
   services that are safe and easy to use without forcing you to learn the vaugaries
   of signing for your particular SDK.   We want to keep this as safe as possible 
   so while you must feed your signing key into our docker image that image runs
   in your actions memory space and is completely destroyed after the signing event
   completes.
